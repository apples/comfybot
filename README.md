# ComfyBot

## Setup

First, make an `appsettings.local.json` file.

Get your Discord bot token, and put it into `appsettings.local.json`.

Launch the bot with `dotnet run`.

In the console output, you will see something like:

```
No swizzler found, using: FB6B62C7BE90E663 (SAVE THIS TO CONFIG)
```

Copy that swizzler value and put it into `appsettings.local.json`.
